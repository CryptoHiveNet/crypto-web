# CryptoWeb

This is a crypto currency software that has been developed by a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This original project comprises three distinct parts, each corresponding to one of three different platforms. Here you are working on the web part which is a Next.js software. Below are some important considerations to keep in mind while working on this project(if you join to this project). You can refer to this file as the project's documentation.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Git
This project has three different branches:
- production
- demo
- development

Git flow for before when you start working on a new feature or fixing a bug is as follows:
1. Pull repo from production
2. Create a new feature/fix branch

Git flow for after you finish working on a new feature or fixing a bug is as follows:
1. Pull request to development branch
2. Rebase it against the development
3. Solving the conflicts
4. Request for review

The feature branch should be created in the below format:
```bash
feature/{issue-number}-{issue-title}
```

Each new feature will be added to the development branch, with no direct pull requests (PRs) to the demo or production branches. New features will be incorporated into the development branch using a squash merge command, resulting in a single commit for each feature. 

We will then use a regular merge command to move changes from the development branch to the demo branch, and similarly from the demo to the production branch.

## Unit Tests
We will use jest and react test library for unit testing. All test files will be located alongside their corresponding files, enabling us to easily update or develop tests when new features are added to specific components. 

Additionally, we have a __tests__ and __mocks__ directories within the src directory for cases where separate test organization are necessary. 

Please always write proper unit tests for your changes to catch everything. Writing enough unit tests show how much you are profession. Don't forget to run your tests manually to make sure everything is working correctly. Also after sending changes on the remote branch and making a MR you need to make sure all automatic tests have passed.

Your changes must'nt make any issues on other tests. In case of having error in other changes you need to make sure your changes are correct and 100 percent in the right path and then you have to talk with the developers to solve the issue. 

When you are going to write a unit test always thing about making an isolation environment for the component/functionality you are going to implement.


## E2E Tests
For end-to-end (E2E) testing, we will use Cypress. E2E tests will be implemented upon the completion of each part of the application. Once the E2E tests are finalized, the feature will be committed to the remote branch, ready to be squash merged into the development branch.

Writing E2E tests is not necessary for all developers and will be done by the team leader on demo branch. However if you thing you need to write some E2E tests for specific components you are welcome to do it. Also if there are some situations where should be considered, Please let the other knows that as a comment in the MR. Also it should be logged in the issue comment part.

## Docker
Please ensure that Docker is installed and running on your machine. To install the Docker image, you just need to run the following command:
```bash
docker build -t prefered-name .
```

After this step, the Docker image will be installed on your local machine. Then, to run the Docker image, use the following command:

```bash
docker up prefered-name
```

## State management and data fetching
To fetch data and also for state management, In this project we will use[ react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) which is known as TanStack Query. To get more information about how you should use react-query in a project, please click [here](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/overview).


## Clean code and comments
Each component should feature clean, well-written code with minimal comments. We adhere to the principle that code should be self-explanatory, thereby reducing the need for extensive commenting. However, it is essential to include clear and concise comments that clarify the following aspects:

- The purpose and functionality of the code.
- The input and output arguments.

For internal documentation, we will use single-line comments. Multi-line comments are reserved for external documentation.

These titles will be used for commits names:
feat: Used when adding a new feature or functionality.
chore: Used for routine tasks like package updates.
refactor: Used when refactoring code without adding new features.
fix: Used when fixing a bug.
test: Used for adding or modifying tests.
doc: Used for updating the documentation.


## How to install a new package?
To install a package, use npm. Before adding any new components, please seek approval from the team leader to ensure their necessity and alignment with our project goals.

## How to work on a feature?

To develop/implement a feature, please follow these steps:
- Update your local development branch to get sure you have the latest version:
```bash
git checkout development
git pull origin development
```

- Add a new feature branch with name "feature-{feature name}" form the development branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature-{feature name}
```

- Start working on the feature branch by adding a new commits for different parts of the feature(choose the right ccommit's title type)

- Send the commits to the remote branch 
```bash
git pull origin development
git push origin feature-{feature name}
```
- Continue developing the feature, adding more commits to the remote branch upon completing each part locally.

- Make a PR to the development branch after finishing the whole feature.

- Add other developers to review the feature.

- Make necessary changes based on the review feedback.

- Repeat the above steps to finalize the feature.

When you are working on a feature, Please consider these concepts:

- Don't ask for a review otherwise you are totally sure that the feature is ready to be reviewed.
- Each time before pushing commits to the feature branch on the remote server, Please make sure that your local feature branch is up to date with the remote development branch.
- Each time after following to preceding step, If you saw some conflicts, you have to solve those conflicts without removing the other people code!
- Choose the right and the most appropriate title for your commits.
